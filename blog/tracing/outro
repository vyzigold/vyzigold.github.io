I've shown you how to configure 2 different ways of getting traces from openstack services. The data you get are pretty similar, although OSProfiler uses some manual instrumentation and so it should be able to get all the interesting traces, while autoinstrumentation could miss something. OSProfiler is also easier to extend to collect additional data.

I tried to do some simple performance comparison of the 2 options. You can find the script I used as well as some detailed description of how I mesured the performance and the result in the following repository: https://github.com/vyzigold/openstack-tracing-perftest/tree/main . In short the performance between OSProfiler and OTEL autoinstrumentation was pretty similar and the API calls in devstack were about 2% slower when compared to not using tracing in that particullar scenario I tested. Important note about the testing though. OSProfiler and OTEL autoinstrumentation have a few differences in the data they collect as explained above. I also had some difficulties with Nova and Neutron when using OSProfiler, so while the measured performance is similar, the amount of data each tool was collecting was unfortunatelly a little different, which certainly influenced the results. Another, different measurement needs to be done in order to be able to correctly compare the performance hit of each option.
