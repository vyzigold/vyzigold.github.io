title: About me
---

I'm a software engineer at Red Hat. I work on OpenStack https://www.openstack.org/ telemetry. As part of that I'm contributing to the OpenStack telemetry projects like Ceilometer and Aodh. I'm also active in the openstack-k8s-operators https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators, which aims to develop a set of operators to deploy OpenStack on top of Kubernetes, I contribute mainly to the telemetry-operator.

In this blog, I want to write about some interesting topics and ideas I encounter during my work. This might be something I researched, or implemented, something I see as interesting and I think others might also consider it interesting. There are many different flavors and ways to deploy OpenStack. My main experience is with deploying on top of OpenShift with the openstack-k8s-operators, but as part of the upstream development I also work a lot with devstack. So most of my blogposts will be aimed either for openstack-k8s-operators or devstack.

If you're interested to know more about me. I'm Czech, I'm a volunteer firefighter, I like Star Trek, beer and [firesport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tUCGp_jbVw)
